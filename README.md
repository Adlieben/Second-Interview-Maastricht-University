# Structure

The required documents for the second interview can be found in the following folders:

- *Data*: contains the data provided to run the analysis (covidpredict-1.xlsx), as well as the data downloaded from the [World Health Organization website](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data?n=c) (WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv) that was used to make inferences on covid-19 incidence rates in December 2021.
- *Images*: contains the logo of Utrecht University used in the presentation.
- *Scripts*: contains files related to the abstract (Abstract analysis.Rmd) and the R script used to derive the main findings of the analysis (Main analysis.R).

The other files present in this repository relate to the presentation to be delivered on February the 19th. As such, some of these may still be partially incomplete.
